## Divide your salary into three bank account

	1 Income Account
	2 Spend-It Account
	3 Invest-it Account
	

Once your salary hits your Income Account, within thirty minutes (OK,
take a day – but do it) move out your monthly expenditure to your Spend-it
Account. And whatever is left, move it to your Invest-it Account. Salary
accounts are usually zero-balance accounts, so sweeping all the money out is
possible.
  
  
For the first three months to see how much I need in my Spend-it Account. If it runs dry, move more from Income to Spend. Moving money from Invest-it to Spend-it is not allowed



> [!NOTE] Expenditure of your Income
> Budgets are boring. Instead of mapping the small expenses,
have these rules of thumb in your mind. If you are going
consistently over these limits, you need a relook at where
your money is going. Eating out, going to the movies, travelling
and buying gadgets are the big budget breakers. Go for a
balanced, rather than a hard, spending diet. Hard diets fail.
You are doing OK if …
	1. you have a three-account system that separates your
	income, spending and savings;
	2. your spending on living costs is no more than 45–50 per
	cent of your take-home income;
	3. your EMI payouts are no more than 25–30 per cent of your
	take-home income;
	4. your savings are at least 15–20 per cent of your take-home
	income.

## EMERGENCIES NEED A FUND
 

Keeping money ready for an emergency is important. Not only do you not
have to worry about the money when you need it but it also frees up
money for long-term investments.


A rough rule of thumb says keep aside six months’ living costs. Include
everything in it – rent, EMI, school fees, utilities, premiums, credit card charges, club memberships, whatever. The cash flow system that we created
earlier will tell you what your monthly transfer to your Spend-it account is.
Multiply that by six.
Remember this is an average; you can increase or decrease this amount
depending on your personal situation. Suppose both you and your spouse earn
– the probability of both of you losing jobs at the same time is low; in addition,
if there are no dependants – you are a double-income no-kids household.
In such lower-risk households, the emergency fund amount can be reduced
to three months’ spending. But if one salary is fully going towards the EMI, it
makes sense to have a bit more than six months’ living costs in the emergency
fund, and not less.
On the other extreme, if you are the sole earner of a house that has your
spouse, kids and parents to support, along with an EMI to pay, you’re better off
having up to a year’s worth of spending in the emergency fund. So, lower the
risk to the household, lower is the number of months’ spending you need to
cover for in the emergency fund. And higher the risk, higher the amount you
save.

### Where do you keep this money?

State Bank of India gave 3.5 per cent
interest on the savings deposit. You need to move it to a place that is not that
easy to access, but yet is liquid enough to be of use when you want it and gives a
return that is better than a savings deposit.

## Medical Insurance

We buy a medical cover so that when faced with a hospital bill we don’t have to
dip into our savings. The deal is simple: You pay an annual premium and when
you get hospitalised, the insurance company pays the bill. But then it is a
complicated world. Insurance companies have the ability to set up the game so
that you lose. And given how technical an insurance product is, there is no way
you will know all that there is to know. You need to find out if your policy gives
at least these eight benefits.


### Ensure that you have a policy that does not have something called a ‘co-pay' clause
 This is called ‘co-pay’ because you agree to pay a certain percentage
of a bill to share the costs with the insurance company. Unfair, you exclaim. It
is, except when a senior citizen goes to buy a cover, co-pay allows him to at least
get a cover. More of that later. For example, if you agree to a co-pay of 10 per
cent, you have agreed to pick up one-tenth of the cost of the hospitalisation. If
your bill is Rs 2 lakhs, you will have to pay Rs 20,000 and the insurance
company will pay 90 per cent or Rs 1.8 lakhs.
Look for a policy that does not have a co-pay clause. Ask your agent to mail
you the policy document and then do a search on the words co-pay. Search the
net to see if the policy being sold has complaints related to it having a co-pay
clause. Build an email trail with the company or the agent to ensure that youhave something in writing that ensures that you have not been lied to. The
presence of an evil co-pay clause has caused plenty of curses to fly in the
direction of insurance companies when the glitzy promises of care turn into
castles of sand at the time of a health crisis. 

### Check for a ‘pre-existing’ disease clause
Insurance companies will not cover diseases that you already have when you take the policy. Insurance rules allow a company to refuse to pay for any treatment related to any condition, ailment or injury for which you were diagnosed or had symptoms when you
took the policy, for four years.
For example, if you were diagnosed with kidney stones and took a policy
soon after, the company is within its rights not to pay for the surgery to remove
those stones if it happens in the next four years. But there are companies that
waive or reduce this waiting period, to pay up earlier. Check to see how long the
waiting period is in the policy you shortlist.


### Check if your policy has a ‘disease waiting period
Many companies have a cool-off period of thirty to ninety days during which they will not pay any claim. Some ailments such as cataract or hernia may have a ‘waiting period’
before the company will pay. Ask the agent to list out all diseases that are
covered under this clause. Look for a policy that does not have a waiting period
on diseases or coverage.


### Check if your policy has ‘sub-limits’
A friend was admitted for a knee
surgery to one of Delhi’s upmarket hospitals. Confident of a Rs 4-lakh cover,
she selected a single deluxe room. When the time for the payout came, theinsurance company refused to pay the room rent, which was over Rs 8,000 a
day. Her policy had a sub-limit of 1 per cent, which is the portion of the cover
that can be spent on room rent. Her cover was Rs 4 lakhs, so her room rent over
Rs 8,000 a day was not paid by the policy. Other expenses were also paid in line
with a Rs 8,000-room, reducing the claim amount even more as some hospitals
hike charges according to room rent.


### Check for exclusions
A policy will list out diseases, conditions and
medical services that the policy does not cover. Dental treatment, pregnancy
and cosmetic surgery are standard exclusions. It is a good idea to get a list of all
that is excluded in the policy you buy. What you can’t do much about is when
the policy you buy excludes something at some future point in the policy. One
firm excluded a costly cancer injection midway in a policy and people who
bought the plan and made a claim were not paid for that injection. The dice is
loaded against us, the individual customers of mediclaim.


### Ask how much of the costs before and after hospitalisation the policy will cover

You can claim expenditure made on doctor’s fees, medicines and
diagnostic tests done before a planned hospitalisation and for three months
afterwards. For example, a knee replacement will have MRI costs before the
surgery and physiotherapy costs post surgery. Check if you can claim these costs.
Check the exact amount and time your policy will cover.


### Ask for a list of ‘day-care’ procedures that don’t need you to stay for twenty-four hours in a hospital any more
Procedures and treatment such as a cataract surgery or surgery for a ligament tear (there is a standard list of 130 such procedures) are treated as ‘day-care’ procedures and are covered. Check the details of the day-care clause, what will be covered, how much will be paid and how long you have to stay to claim.

### Look at the ‘no-claims bonus’ feature

When you don’t make a claim in a
year, you get rewarded by the insurance company. It does this by giving a ‘no-
claims bonus’ (NCB). The usual way is to raise your cover by 10 per cent for the
same premium. If your cover was Rs 15 lakhs, for a premium of Rs 25,000,
when you have a claim-free year, you get a cover of Rs 16.5 lakhs for the same
premium.





#### Strategies for older people
Many people who are over sixty-five are sitting on Rs 1–3 lakh of medical
covers. Bought in the era of lower medical costs and no five-star hospitals, these
are quite inadequate for the current medical costs. We know that insurance
companies resist insuring older people. What to do? The best way to get a larger
cover is to use what is called a ‘top-up’ plan.
Think of this as a policy that will pay up after a certain threshold amount has
been paid by you. Suppose you have an existing policy for Rs 3-lakh medical
cover. Now you buy a top-up plan that gives you another Rs 5 lakhs of cover,
but after a Rs 3-lakh deductible. If your medical bill is Rs 4 lakhs, you will pay
Rs 3 lakhs from your basic policy and Rs 1 lakh from your top-up.
Even if you get admitted twice, with Rs 2 lakhs your bill each time, your
costs still will be covered. Remember to buy a top-up that allows you to claim
after the deductible is covered across different episodes in hospital. If you are
unable to get even a top-up, targeting your own medical fund is your only
option. Talk to your kids if you don’t have the surplus. Many of them will be##
able to get you on to their work-given group health insurance plans.

## Emergency Death Fund

Agent with Term Insurance is mostly fraud. Try to read as much as possible before buying
They get Commission upto 45% on the first year if the plan worth is 10,000
agent gets 4,500.
How much cover do I need?If you died today, think of all the expenses that the family has ahead of them.
Now think of how much they will need to put away in a fixed deposit or a tax-
free bond or a mutual fund to generate a regular income? The rule of thumb is
that you need eight to ten times your take-home annual income. Or fifteen to
twenty times your annualized monthly expenditure.

### When's a good time to buy?
Buy as soon as you have dependants or the possibility of getting dependants arises.
Touching thirty is usually a good time to buy the cover. You are old enough
to have a good income flow and dependants, but not that old for covers to be
too expensive. The cost of life cover rises exponentially as you age. A cover of Rs
1 crore for a thirty-year-old will cost between Rs 8,000–10,000 a year. For a
forty-five-year-old, this cost will more than double.


Rule One:
	 Get a cheap plan. The online plans are the cheapest since they remove
	the agent commission (up to 42 per cent of your first-year premium) – from
	the price of the insurance. When term plans were launched online some years
	ago, the prices dropped by almost half! A policy sold by an agent costs twice as
	much as the policy you buy online.


Rule Two:
	When buying a term cover, check the claims experience of the insurance firm.
	Shortlist three or four policies that you like in terms of low prices for your age,
	cover and tenure, and then start looking at the claims experience. This is not so
	easy to find. A claims experience of over 95 per cent is fine. This means that the
	company pays 95 per cent of the claims filed. Do a simple google search on this
	metric to see which firms show up.

Have a plan?
	You need to have a plan for the people left behind. Imagine this: Your spouse,
	who is not an active participant in the financial decisions, is suddenly hit with
	the trauma of you copping it early and a large lump sum hitting the bank. You
	need to have a plan in place that will guide her

==The job of the life insurance cover is to serve you till you are debt-free and==
==financially independent.== The moment that happens you can stop your term
insurance plan. Remember that these are annual contracts; if you terminate it,
you lose nothing. You lose a lot if you terminate your endowment policies
midway. One more reason to just stay with a term plan

There are three asset classes that we need to understand. Debt, equity and real
assets.

### Debt
Let’s start with what we understand really well. We are already investing in the
category called ‘debt’. We may not call it that. The word ‘debt’ makes us think
of the debts that we have – car loans, home loans and credit card loans. But
when used by the sharp Suits, debt means the cell with products that give you an
assured return – like a bank fixed deposit or a tax-free bond or a public
provident fund.

Ever wondered why government bonds pay the lowest interest? Because they
are the safest. That is why a real-estate company will have to offer interest rates
on its corporate deposits much higher than a bank FD to get your money. They
are offering a higher interest as a sweetener for the higher risk you take. You
must remember this each time you are offered a company deposit or a ‘scheme’
that offers you very high interest rates. The higher the return it promises, the
higher is the risk – even in a product you think is ‘safe’ like a company deposit.

The role of debt products in your money box is to provide money at short notice
and to provide stability to your long-term investments. Debt products need to
give you a degree of certainty that the money will be there when you want it.
This is unlike equity which is much more volatile – prices go up and down
almost on a daily basis. They also make up the core of your long-term
investments. For example, your EPF (employees’ provident fund) and PPF
(public provident fund) are the core of your retirement corpus. These are safe,
tax-free, and provide that rock-solid core to your portfolio.
Why not put all your money into debt products? After all we want to be
certain about what we get back in the future?
We don’t put all our long-term money into debt because we want the
growth that equity can give to our money. Debt products are good for stability
but not for growth.

### Gold

The only way you can profit from gold is when its value goes up – when you actually make a
profit. So, how good is gold for getting capital gains or profits?
The answer is it depends when you bought it and how long you held it. If
you bought gold three years ago, you’d have got a 2 or 3 per-cent return. If you
bought five year ago, you may have just got your investment back – that is, zero
return. If you bought ten years ago, your return is around 9 per cent per year.

Given the role of gold in our families and the need to gift gold at weddings
in India, do buy gold. But buy it sensibly. Not more than 5–10 per cent of your
total portfolio goes into gold. You do not buy jewellery as investment. Your
options to buy gold are coins, bars, gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and
gold bonds from the government. As of 2017, the smart investment decision is
to buy the bonds issued by the Government of India; these bonds give you not
only the full market value of gold when you sell the bonds in the future, but also
a 2.5 per cent interest on your investment each year. All other ways of holding
gold have a cost attached to them and do not give a regular return. I’m ignoring
all the tax-not-paid cash that goes into gold. We’re only dealing with legit
money.

### Real estate
The real-estate story. 
	It is a horrible, clunky, chunky investment that
	has lots of costs, which people forget to add to the profit maths. It is illiquid – you
	can’t sell in a hurry. You can’t sell one room to raise some funds – you need to
	sell the whole darn property. It needs periodic investments for maintenance.
	For society flats, there is the added cost of high charges. But we remain wedded
	to real estate.
Have one roof over your head that's enough else it's a horrible investment

### Equity

The most misunderstood of all asset classes, stocks are not a lottery
where some people get lucky. There is a math and science, and a way to
take risk safely

> Equity is a slow cook and not instant noodles.
